# Gooogle Map Clone app 
This react appl

This app is a clone of the Google Maps app, built using headless UI. Headless UI is a framework that allows you to build UIs without having to worry about the underlying DOM. This makes it a great choice for building apps that need to be highly performant or that need to be able to render on different devices.

The app is still under development, but it already has the following features:

Search for locations
Get directions to locations
View a map of the world
To run the app, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed. Once you have those installed, you can run the following commands:

npm install
npm start


The app will then be running on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.

The app will then be running on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.
