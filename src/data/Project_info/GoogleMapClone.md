# 🗺️ Google Maps Clone: A Headless UI Application

This is a **Google Maps clone** built with **React** and leveraging the power of **headless UI** components. Headless UI libraries provide unstyled, accessible, and highly customizable UI primitives, giving developers full control over the visual presentation while handling the complex logic and accessibility concerns behind the scenes. This approach results in a highly performant and flexible application.

This app is currently in active development and includes the following core features:

* 📍 **Location Search:** Find any place on the map with a powerful search bar.
* 🚗 **Directions:** Get turn-by-turn directions to your desired destination.
* 🌐 **Interactive Map:** Pan and zoom to explore the world with a fluid, responsive map interface.
