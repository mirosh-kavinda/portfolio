## 👨‍💻 Responsibilities  
- **Project Leader** and **Developer**  
- Implemented steel bar detection model with CNN  
- Integrated backend with Firebase for real-time stock management  
- Coordinated ERP system integration with mobile app  
- Built a **Flask API** to connect with ERP solutions via API calls  
- **Containerized** the entire model using **Docker** and deployed it on customers’ work computers

## ⚙️ Methodology  
The application leverages a **Python computer vision script** for steel bar detection in images:  
- **CNN-based Candidate Detection** → Detects candidate steel bar centers  
- **Clustering Algorithm** → Groups candidate centers  
- **Visualization** → Displays bounding boxes and clustered centers  
- **Flask API Integration** → Provides connectivity with ERP solutions  
- **Docker Deployment** → Ensures portability and smooth deployment on customer systems
